Unofficial K-10 SDK.  
It was developped before the [official SDK](http://kleininstruments.com/Downloads/SDK%20Package%20v2.01%20-%20Beta.rar) was released.  
(Windows only)  

ColorHealer should definitively use the official one (TODO).

Precompiled libraries can be found [here](https://github.com/downloads/mikrosimage/OpenDisplayCalibrator/klein_k10_precompiled_libs.zip).
