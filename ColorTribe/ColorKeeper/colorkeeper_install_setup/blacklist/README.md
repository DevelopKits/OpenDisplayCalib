**ColorKeeper** can send an email when a station isn't calibrated.

If you know that a station or a monitor doesn't worth to be calibrated, you can black-list it to prevent mail to be sent.

To black list, add a file :  
	- `<manufacturer>_<model>.invalid`  
	or   
	- `<machine name>.invalid`  
in this directory.
