ColorHealer  
-------------------- 
ColorHealer is a measure and calibration tool. 

**Calibration**  

In this mode, ColorKeeper is used to display color patches at the right time.  
For that, you'll need to open a TCP/IP connection between ColorHealer and ColorKeeper (ColorCalib tab of ColorKeeper). 
   
Calibration protocol has been developped in collaboration with ENS Louis Lumi√®re school. 
This protocol allow the calibrator to adjust OSD settings of a screen to match a chosen standard (ex : REC709) and process a 2D LUT that ColorKeeper will use to correct screen gamma.

**Measure**  

You can use measure mode with or without ColorKeeper. Without, you'll have to display color patch by yourself, using Paint or Gimp for example.  
  
3 modes of measures are available :  
*  Single measure 
*  Continuous measure
*  Batch measures
In each mode, measures are displayed in a diagram (CIE 1931 or CIE 1976) and an HTML report can be exported.

**Supported probes**
* Konica-Minolta CS-200
* Klein K-10
* Datacolor Spyders (but you'll have to ask datacolor for a API autorization key

ColorHealer used to support EyeOne display and EyeOne Pro but we're not allowed to share this code in the opensource project.
